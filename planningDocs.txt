Brainstorming
hike recommendation/review app? -> similar to "Trip list" idea in FRODO


Project name:

Potential MVPs
Base Minimum:

create lists of hikes with themes (lazy (easy) hikes, desert hikes, mountain, etc.)
add/delete form for saving specific hikes to lists
drop down menu for hike rating


Additional potential:

Account creation? Log in form?
Multiple pages to navigate to?
use weather API?
use location API for getting nearby hikes from specified locations?

Wireframing: fig jam - figma tool 

Coding TODO:

Get basic HTML set up for MVPs, being mindful of making classes for each necessary element for styling
Work on CSS ([header], [body containing nav, content, possibly sidebar], [footer]) - use CSS Grids?
Write out basic functionality for each MVP in front-end JS
